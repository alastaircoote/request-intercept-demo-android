# Request Interception Demo

A very simple of demo of how you might use an Android webview to serve a mix of locally cached assets and remote content. It's very unpolished, but should hopefully convey the idea.

All the relevant code is in `WebViewHolder.kt`. Compare the browser view in-app with the one you get when loading:

    https://request-intercept-demo.glitch.me

in any other browser.

### iOS Version

There's an iOS equivalent of this at:
